# GCNN analysis for Trait classification 

The code is partially taken and adapted from "Classification of Cancer Types Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks" by Ramiret et al., which was originally took the code from "Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering" by Defferrard et al.

The used network is a generalization of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), intended to work on bot low-dimensional regular grids, and high-dimensional irregular domains, such as our study case, represented by graphs.

This architecture presents a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, offering the same linear computational complexity and constant learning complexity as classical CNNs, while being universal to any graph structure
